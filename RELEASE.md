# Jojo LLM Training Script - Release Notes

## Version 2.0.3 "PyTorch 2.6+ Compatibility" - July 5, 2025

### 🔧 **PyTorch Compatibility Fixes**

#### **Fixed PyTorch 2.6+ Checkpoint Loading**
- **Issue**: PyTorch 2.6+ changed default `weights_only=True` in `torch.load()`, causing checkpoint loading failures
- **Error**: `"Weights only load failed"` and `"Unsupported global: GLOBAL torch.torch_version.TorchVersion"`
- **Solution**: Updated all checkpoint loading calls to explicitly use `weights_only=False` for trusted checkpoint files
- **Files Updated**: 
  - `gen.py` - Text generation checkpoint loading
  - `trainer.py` - Training checkpoint restoration  
  - `train_old.py` - Legacy training script
  - `regenerate_plot.py` - Already correctly implemented

#### **Enhanced Checkpoint Format Compatibility**
- **Issue**: New training system uses `config.model` structure vs old `model_args` format
- **Solution**: Updated `gen.py` to handle both checkpoint formats automatically:
  1. **New format**: `checkpoint['config']['model']` (current training system)
  2. **Old format**: `checkpoint['model_args']` (legacy compatibility)
- **Benefits**: Seamless generation from checkpoints created by any version of the training system

#### **Improved Error Messages**
- **Before**: Generic "Missing model_args" error
- **After**: Clear indication of expected formats: "Missing 'model_args' or 'config.model'"
- **User Experience**: Better guidance for troubleshooting checkpoint format issues

#### **Testing Verified**
- ✅ Text generation working with new checkpoint format
- ✅ All checkpoint loading operations compatible with PyTorch 2.6+
- ✅ Backward compatibility maintained for older checkpoints

## Version 2.0.2 "Improved Loss Plotting" - July 5, 2025

### 🔧 **Plotting System Fixes**

#### **Fixed Loss Curve Visualization Issue**
- **Issue**: Loss curve plots only showed one data point for train and validation loss
- **Root Cause**: Plotting logic prioritized epoch-level metrics (1 point) over available batch-level data (hundreds of points)
- **Solution**: Enhanced plotting algorithm with intelligent data source selection:
  1. **First Priority**: Use evaluation metrics (`train_loss_eval`, `val_loss_eval`) when available
  2. **Smart Fallback**: For training loss, use smoothed batch-level data when epoch data has ≤2 points
  3. **Validation Handling**: Gracefully handle single validation points by positioning them appropriately on timeline

#### **Enhanced Plot Quality**
- **Batch Data Smoothing**: When using batch-level training loss, automatically smooth to ~100 points for cleaner visualization
- **Axis Alignment**: Single validation points are positioned at the end of training timeline for proper context
- **Visual Improvements**: 
  - Different markers for different data densities (dots for dense data, squares for sparse)
  - Clearer axis labels indicating data type ("Training Step (Smoothed)" vs "Step")
  - Improved annotations with "Min Train" and "Min Val" labels

#### **Backward Compatibility**
- **Existing Checkpoints**: All existing checkpoints with limited metrics now generate proper curves
- **Future Training**: New training runs with evaluation intervals will use optimal evaluation data
- **Data Preference**: System automatically selects best available data source without user intervention

#### **Technical Details**
- Plotting now handles datasets with missing evaluation metrics (common in older checkpoints)
- Smoothing algorithm: `smooth_interval = max(1, len(batch_losses) // 100)`
- Validation point positioning: Single points placed at `max_train_step` for context

## Version 2.0.1 "Enhanced Loss Tracking" - July 5, 2025

### 🐛 **Bug Fixes & Improvements**

#### **Fixed Best Loss Logic Bug**
- **Issue**: Final evaluation results could show final loss better than "best" loss due to timing of metric updates
- **Solution**: Added comprehensive final evaluation metric updates to ensure accuracy
- **Impact**: Best/worst loss reporting is now 100% accurate throughout training

#### **Enhanced Loss Tracking System**
- **New Metrics**: Added comprehensive loss tracking for both training and validation:
  - `best_train_loss` - Best training loss achieved during training
  - `worst_train_loss` - Worst training loss encountered
  - `best_val_loss` - Best validation loss achieved (improved logic)
  - `worst_val_loss` - Worst validation loss encountered
- **Visual Enhancement**: Worst losses displayed in red color for immediate identification
- **Checkpoint Integration**: All loss metrics saved and restored in checkpoints

#### **Improved Training Summary**
- **Before**: Limited to final train/val loss and best val loss (3 metrics)
- **After**: Complete loss analysis with 6 metrics showing training progression
- **Better Insights**: Users can now see full training performance range from worst to best

#### **Example Output**
```
╔═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╗
║                TRAINING COMPLETED                     ║
╚═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════╝

```

### 🔧 **Technical Details**

- **Metric Updates**: Both periodic evaluations and final assessment now update all loss metrics
- **Thread Safety**: Proper metric tracking during concurrent operations
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing checkpoints load correctly with default values for new metrics

### 📊 **Benefits**

- **Debugging**: Easier identification of training instability by comparing best vs worst
- **Model Selection**: Better understanding of model convergence patterns  
- **Training Analysis**: Complete picture of training dynamics and loss evolution
