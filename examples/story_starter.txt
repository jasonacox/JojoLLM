Once upon a time in a magical forest, there lived a curious young fox named Rusty. His bright orange fur shimmered in the sunlight as he explored the ancient woods.

One morning, Rusty discovered a strange glowing stone beneath an old oak tree. As he touched it with his paw, the stone began to pulse with an ethereal blue light.

"How curious," Rusty whispered to himself.
