   - Separate function for device setup
   - Separate function for prompt loading
   - Dedicated interactive mode handler

2. **Enhanced Documentation**
   - Improved function docstrings
   - Added example files in examples/
   - More comprehensive help text

3. **Robustness**
   - Improved token validation in process_token()
   - Added max_tokens support to generate_stream()
   - Better handling of special tokens

## Backend Improvements

1. **Model Integration**
   - Updated model.generate_stream() to support max_tokens
   - Added exception handling in streaming generation
   - Better token validity checking

## Implementing Special Tokens for Chat Templates

### Current Implementation
The project currently uses plain text markers for chat roles:
```
Human: [message]
Assistant: [message]
```

### Proposed Special Token Implementation
Switching to the following format:
```
<|im_start|>user
[message]
<|im_end|>
<|im_start|>assistant
[message]
<|im_end|>
```

### Implementation Challenges

1. **Tokenizer Modification**
   - Tiktoken doesn't natively support adding custom tokens like HuggingFace tokenizers
   - Need to either:
     - Create a custom BPE tokenizer with the special tokens included
     - Use existing unused token IDs and map them to the special tokens
     - Modify tiktoken or wrap it to handle these special tokens

2. **Dataset Preparation Updates**
   - All dataset preparation scripts need updates:
     - `prepare-chat.py`
     - `prepare-chitchat.py` 
     - `prepare-dailydialog.py`
   - Need to regenerate all training data with the new format

3. **Generation Code Changes**
   - Update `gen.py` to properly format prompts with these tokens
   - Modify any templates or example files

4. **Compatibility Concerns**
   - Models trained on the old format won't work with the new format
   - Need a migration path or parallel implementations

### Implementation Difficulty

**Estimated difficulty: Moderate to High**

The main technical challenge is adding custom tokens to tiktoken, which doesn't have straightforward methods for this like HuggingFace tokenizers do. Options include:

1. **Custom Tokenizer Approach**
   - Fork and modify tiktoken to support custom tokens
   - Create a completely new tokenizer based on BPE principles
   - Use a HuggingFace tokenizer as a replacement

2. **Workarounds**
   - Use existing unused token IDs and map them to special tokens
   - Use string substitution before/after tokenization
   - Create a wrapper around tiktoken that handles the special tokens

3. **Implementation Time**
   - Initial prototype: 1-2 days
   - Complete implementation with all datasets: 3-5 days
   - Testing and validation: 1-2 days

### Benefits of Implementation

1. More token-efficient conversations (fewer tokens per exchange)
2. Better role separation for the model to understand
3. Reduced likelihood of the model generating role markers inappropriately 
4. Alignment with industry standards for chat models
5. Improved control over generation behavior

### Recommended Next Steps

1. Create a prototype implementation for one small dataset
2. Test tokenization and regeneration with the new format
3. Evaluate model training on the new format
4. If successful, update all datasets and retrain

These changes significantly enhance the usability, robustness, and functionality of the text generation utility while maintaining full compatibility with existing workflows.
