# Improvements Made to gen.py

## New Features Added

1. **Enhanced Device Selection**
   - Auto-detection of CUDA devices with memory info
   - Support for MPS (Apple Silicon) with proper fallback
   - Better error handling for device selection

2. **Improved Prompt Handling**
   - Added `--prompt_file` option to load prompts from files
   - Better handling of empty prompts
   - UTF-8 encoding support for prompts

3. **Interactive Mode**
   - New `--interactive` flag for continuous prompt-generation interaction
   - Persistent history with readline support
   - Timestamp-based naming for output files in interactive mode

4. **Enhanced Error Handling**
   - More specific error messages for common failure cases
   - Graceful handling of CUDA out of memory errors
   - Better token validation and processing

5. **Improved Output Options**
   - Auto-creation of output directories
   - Combined prompt+output saving
   - Better formatting of saved content

6. **Other Usability Improvements**
   - Added `--verbose` flag for detailed information
   - Improved signal handling for clean interruption
   - Better feedback about model loading and generation

## Code Structure Improvements

1. **Modularization**
   - Separate function for device setup
   - Separate function for prompt loading
   - Dedicated interactive mode handler

2. **Enhanced Documentation**
   - Improved function docstrings
   - Added example files in examples/
   - More comprehensive help text

3. **Robustness**
   - Improved token validation in process_token()
   - Added max_tokens support to generate_stream()
   - Better handling of special tokens

## Backend Improvements

1. **Model Integration**
   - Updated model.generate_stream() to support max_tokens
   - Added exception handling in streaming generation
   - Better token validity checking

These changes significantly enhance the usability, robustness, and functionality of the text generation utility while maintaining full compatibility with existing workflows.
